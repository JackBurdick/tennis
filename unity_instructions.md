### Unity Installation

Unity ML-Agents installation [instructions](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md)

### Obtain the Environment

Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86_64.zip)

Place the file in this working directory, and unzip. 


### Environment Initialization

```python
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="/home/jackburdick/dev/tennis/Tennis_Linux_NoVis/Tennis.x86_64")

```

### Environment States + Actions

```python
# get the default brain
brain_name = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[brain_name]

# reset the environment
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]

# number of agents 
num_agents = len(env_info.agents)
print('Number of agents:', num_agents)

# size of each action
action_size = brain.vector_action_space_size
print('Size of each action:', action_size)

# examine the state space 
states = env_info.vector_observations
state_size = states.shape[1]
print('There are {} agents. Each observes a state with length: {}'.format(states.shape[0], state_size))
print('The state for the first agent looks like:', states[0])

env.close()
```

```

### Take Random Actions in the Environment

```python
for i in range(1, 6):                                      # play game for 5 episodes
    env_info = env.reset(train_mode=False)[brain_name]     # reset the environment    
    states = env_info.vector_observations                  # get the current state (for each agent)
    scores = np.zeros(num_agents)                          # initialize the score (for each agent)
    while True:
        actions = np.random.randn(num_agents, action_size) # select an action (for each agent)
        actions = np.clip(actions, -1, 1)                  # all actions between -1 and 1
        env_info = env.step(actions)[brain_name]           # send all actions to tne environment
        next_states = env_info.vector_observations         # get next state (for each agent)
        rewards = env_info.rewards                         # get reward (for each agent)
        dones = env_info.local_done                        # see if episode finished
        scores += env_info.rewards                         # update the score (for each agent)
        states = next_states                               # roll over states to next time step
        if np.any(dones):                                  # exit loop if episode finished
            break
    print('Score (max over agents) from episode {}: {}'.format(i, np.max(scores)))
```


### NOTE on `brains` terminology

Environments contain **_brains_** which are responsible for deciding the actions of their associated agents. 

Here we've selected the first brain available and set it as the default brain (which we'll be controlling)


### NOTE on training in the environment

When training, set `train_mode=True`, so that the line for resetting the environment looks like the following:
```python
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]
```
